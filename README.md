# Project: Recipes

This is a project for The Odin Project's 'HTML Foundations' Course.

The project consists of a series of pages, each of which
contains a recipe for a dessert, except for the home
page, which contains links to all the recipes pages.

This project covers HTML structure, basic text formatting, lists, images and links (including navigation between pages on the same site).
